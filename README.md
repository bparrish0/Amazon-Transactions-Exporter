This Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script adds a panel to the Amazon Transactions page for exporting data to JSON or CSV. It fetches each orderâ€™s page to include item descriptions in the export, which I use to reconcile and categorize transactions in budgeting tracking applications.

I use the Transactions page instead of the Orders page for reconciliation, since credit cards are often billed separately when items ship at different times. The Transactions page matches credit card charges and account statements more accurately than the Orders page.
