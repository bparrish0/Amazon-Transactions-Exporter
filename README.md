This Greasemonkey script displays a panel on the Amazon Transactions page which will allow exporting transactions to JSON or CSV. It visits the order page of each transaction and loads the descriptions for each purchased item into the export as well. I use this when reconciling transactions in my budgeting software (YNAB) so that I can get categorize transactions and separate out business transactions.
